# Heading Level

Paragraph
---------

I really like using markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my document from now on.

## Line Break

First line with two spaces after.
And the next line

First line with the HTML tag after.<br>
And the next line

## Bold and Italic

I just love **bold** text.<br>
I just love __bold__ text.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.<br>
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.

This text is realy ***very*** important text.<br>
This text is realy ___very___ important text.

## Blockquote

> I love markdown.
>
> Paragraph and Line break are different.
>> Nested Blockquotes

> #### Head 4
>
> - apple
> - peach
>
> **Everything** is OK.

## Code

At the command prompt, type `nano`.

      <html>
        <head>
          HEAD
        </head>
      </html>

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.<br>
To create code blocks without indenting lines, use **fenced code blocks**.

## Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (\*\*\*), dashes (\-\-\-), or underscores (\_\_\_) on a line by themselves.

after a horizontal rule.

## Links

My most hated search engine is [Baidu](https://baidu.com).

My favorite search engine is [Google](https://google.com "This is a title").

Baidu: <https://baidu.com><br>
163mail: <wannademail@163.com>

I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**.<br>
This is the **[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)**.<br>
See the section on [`code`](#code).

Link [one][1]<br>
Link [two][2]

The second part os reference-style link is formatted with the following attributes:

1. The label, in brackets, followed immediately by a colon and at least one space (e.g., [label]: ).
2. The URL for the link, which you can optionally enclose in angle brackets.
3. The optional title for the link, which you can enclose in double quotes, single quotes, or parentheses.

[1]: https://www.baidu.com "title"
[2]: https://www.cn.bing.com (title)
